## 🚀 Welcome to My GitHub!

I'm Mihika, and I have over **5 years of experience** solving complex algorithmic problems and developing innovative solutions. From **AI** to **blockchain**, the possibilites are endless. I seek to build things that push boundaries and have a real-world impact.

### 📍 **Currently at MIT**  
As a **freshman at MIT**, I'm on a mission to explore, experiment, and bring new ideas to life. Whether it's **reinforcement learning**, **supply chain optimization**, or **cybersecurity solutions**, I’m always on the lookout for challenges that blend **cutting-edge technology** with **meaningful influence**.

### 💼 **My Passion Projects**  
A quick peek into my journey of creating technology that matters: 

- **🌍 Sociopolitical Risk Prediction**  
  As a computational finance researcher at the [MITRE Corporation](https://www.mitre.org/), I am working towards building a reinforcement learning model that can predict and quantify sociopolitical risk in **120+ nations** using real-time data.

- **🛠️ Autonomous Vehicle Blockchain**  
  Developed a **decentralized blockchain network** for fully autonomous vehicles to communicate securely in real-time.

- **🏥 CT Scan Radiation Reduction**  
  Created algorithms to minimize radiation exposure in **CT scans**, deployed at local hospitals.

- **🌱 Cybersecurity Solutions for Autonomous Networks**  
  I’m working on a platform that helps autonomous networks reduce **cybersecurity** threats by identifying vulnerable points and ensuring immutability.
